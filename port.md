# Port, Port Number, and Socket

**Port:**
- A port is a communication endpoint or interface that enables applications and services to send and receive data over a network.
- It is a logical construct that allows multiple networked applications to coexist on a single device.

**Port Number:**
- Port numbers are assigned to specific services or protocols to differentiate and route network traffic to the appropriate application or service.
- Port numbers range from 0 to 65,535.
- They are divided into three ranges:
  - Well-known ports (0-1023): Assigned to specific services or protocols by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
  - Registered ports (1024-49,151): Reserved for specific applications or services but not as widely standardized as well-known ports.
  - Dynamic or private ports (49,152-65,535): Available for temporary or ephemeral use by applications when initiating network connections.

**Socket:**
- A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number.
- It represents an endpoint for sending or receiving data over a network.
- Sockets are used to establish network connections between devices and facilitate communication between applications or services.
- A socket consists of:
  - IP address: Identifies the device in a network.
  - Port number: Identifies the application or service running on the device.

**Key Concepts:**
- Ports and port numbers provide a mechanism for multiplexing multiple networked applications on a single device.
- Sockets enable communication by combining the IP address and port number.
- The combination of IP address and port number allows data to be correctly routed to the appropriate application or service on a device.

**Example:**
- When accessing a website using a web browser, the browser communicates with the web server on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
- The combination of the browser's IP address and the server's port number enables the data to be routed to the correct application.

Understanding ports, port numbers, and sockets is essential in network communication as they facilitate the proper routing and delivery of data between applications or services.
