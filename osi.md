# OSI Model - 7 Layers

## 1. Physical Layer
- Lowest layer of the OSI model.
- Deals with the physical transmission of raw data over the network medium.
- Defines electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of the physical connection.

## 2. Data Link Layer
- Provides error-free transfer of data frames between nodes.
- Handles framing, error detection, and flow control.
- Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and PPP operate at this layer.

## 3. Network Layer
- Responsible for routing and forwarding data packets between networks.
- Defines logical addressing and routing protocols.
- IP is a key protocol at this layer.
- Routers operate at this layer.

## 4. Transport Layer
- Provides reliable and transparent transfer of data between end systems.
- Ensures error-free, ordered, and congestion-controlled data delivery.
- TCP provides connection-oriented, reliable transmission.
- UDP offers connectionless, unreliable transmission.

## 5. Session Layer
- Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions.
- Provides session synchronization and recovery.
- Manages session security and supports authentication and encryption.

## 6. Presentation Layer
- Responsible for data representation, encryption, and compression.
- Translates data into a format suitable for network transmission.
- Handles data encryption and decryption.
- Performs data compression and decompression.

## 7. Application Layer
- Topmost layer of the OSI model.
- Provides access to network services and enables data exchange.
- Includes protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.
- Supports tasks like web browsing, email communication, file transfer, etc.
