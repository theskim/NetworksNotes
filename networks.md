# Overlay Networks and Physical Networks

## Physical Network

A physical network refers to the actual infrastructure that carries data between devices. It consists of physical components such as cables, switches, routers, and other networking equipment. Physical networks are responsible for the transmission and routing of data packets across various network devices. Examples of physical networks include Ethernet, Wi-Fi, fiber optic networks, and so on.

**Advantages of Physical Networks:**

- Direct and efficient communication: Physical networks provide a direct and efficient way of transmitting data between devices.
- High reliability: Physical networks generally have higher reliability as they are designed with redundant components and backup systems.
- Low latency: With dedicated hardware and direct connections, physical networks often have lower latency compared to overlay networks.

## Overlay Network

An overlay network is a virtual network that runs on top of a physical network infrastructure. It is created by logically connecting devices or nodes in a distributed manner, regardless of their physical locations. Overlay networks use software-based techniques to establish connections, routing, and other network functions. They often rely on existing physical networks for data transmission.

**Advantages of Overlay Networks:**

- Virtualization and abstraction: Overlay networks provide a layer of abstraction, allowing the creation of virtual networks that can be customized and tailored to specific requirements.
- Flexibility and scalability: Overlay networks can be easily expanded or modified without making changes to the underlying physical network infrastructure.
- Security and isolation: Overlay networks can provide enhanced security features by isolating traffic within the virtual network and implementing encryption and access controls.

Overlay networks are commonly used in various scenarios, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), software-defined networking (SDN), and cloud computing environments. They enable the creation of virtual network overlays that offer additional functionalities or meet specific requirements without the need for extensive changes to the underlying physical network.

## Port 80

Port 80 is the port number assigned to the commonly used internet communication protocol, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is the default network port used to send and receive unencrypted web pages.

## Virtualization

Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage, and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs).
